Hey everyone! I'd like to inaugurate my blog by making this first post! With that, done.

Wait, don't leave yet! That's not all. I'd like to thank you for visiting my blog and my site in general. I'm still setting it up, so please bear with me. Once that's done, I want to continue blogging and making more posts related to my technological adventures and just stuff going on in life. 

I've always wanted to do a blog, and with this new hosting service, I can do just that.

Alright, looks like I'm done for real now. I am serious about this though: there WILL BE more posts headed your way, so stay tuned!

Over and out,
Nitish V.
