On July 29th, 2019, Windows 10 turned four years old. It only seemed like yesterday when I rushed online to get the beta builds on my computer for free in the eighth grade. Read on below to see my thoughts about Windows in this time span.

Also, apologies for posting this a week late and just the long hiatus in general. I was busy finishing up my internship work, so I'm glad to finally have some time to write and post. With that, here we go!

# Intro - before Windows 10

I’ve been a Windows user all my life. My journey started with a Gateway 2000 beige box running Windows 98 Second Edition, and since then, I’ve used every version of Windows, from the good ones (Windows 2000, XP, 7, and 8.1), to the bad ones (Windows Vista and 8.0). I’ve learned all the tips and tricks behind every Windows version, whether it was a design principle, system file, or keyboard shortcut.
Now, the year was 2014, and I was starting my eighth-grade year. Middle school was almost over, and my almost 14-year-old XP machine was acting up after years of use. Luckily, my dad bought home a new ThinkServer. My friend (shout-out to Mel Gunawardena!) and I got to install RAM, a hybrid drive, and the various components that make the computer worth using. Since the machine was a server, the OS wasn’t installed by default, so I took the liberty to install and activate the then-current Windows 8.1 operating system. A month later, I heard about the inception of the Windows Insider Program and a free opportunity to download and test drive the Windows Technical Preview. At the time, Windows 10 was still in its alpha stages and was barely any different from Windows 8.1. I jumped at the news and immediately upgraded to it. 

I was quite pleased at the results. I got an OS that while not fundamentally too different from 8.1, had all of the requested changes from people at the time, like a Start menu, virtual desktops, and a prototype-Action Center. In ways, I had a sense of wonder that I hadn’t felt since I touched XP for the first time.

The next day, I told everyone in my middle school advisory about the new "Windows 10" operating system. Everyone rolled their eyes and gave me weird looks. In fact, one kid in my advisory questioned me about what happened to Windows 9, although there's still no idea as to why Microsoft skipped that number. Perhaps to distance themselves from 8?

Anyways, four years later, I’m still in the program, and I’m still impressed by Microsoft’s efforts and talent in making Windows 10 one of the best and modern operating systems in history.

# Windows 10 Advancements

The Windows 8 operating systems were perhaps some of the most-criticized in the 34-year history of Windows. Microsoft made the OS more touch-centric, removed the traditional Start menu, and made new dumbed-down Windows apps and the then-new Windows Store which was a confusing mess of terrible apps. Windows 8.1 smoothed over some of these complaints, even though what Microsoft did wasn’t enough.

Personally, I haven’t had any issues with Windows 8 or 8.1. While I did think it was awkward to use if you weren’t using Microsoft’s then-new Surface or any other Windows tablet, I did appreciate some of the enhancements it provided over Windows 7. The new File Explorer, Task Manager, and performance improvements were several of the many design decisions in Windows 8 that I readily appreciated.

In Windows 10, Microsoft continued their track record of adding and removing many features. Whether it was removing some of the legacy cruft present since Windows 2000 or adding many new features previously found on only Mac or Linux.

The features that Windows has gained since 8.1 in these four years include:

- The glory of a Start menu
- Virtual desktops and timeline
- Notification center
- Augmented/Virtual Reality support
- Android phone integration with Windows 10
- Light/dark modes
- A better Settings app (the one in 8 was terrible and half-baked)
- WSL (way better for Unix development)
- System-wide search and Cortana
- … and a whole lot more!

There’s a whole lot to list here. Namely, four years into the development of Windows 10, a majority of the developments (oof, used it twice haha) have been namely issued to address the complaints of many frustrated Microsoft customers of time yonder. It’s almost like we see a new improvement in the latest build, and we think, “why didn’t they do this earlier?” Especially with virtual desktops, system-wide search, and touch gestures. I can now realize how poor productivity was on earlier Windows operating systems like 7, XP, and prior compared to Windows 10.

With that, I want to dig in to some of the main complaints about Windows 10 since its public inception almost four years ago:

**Windows Update**

Four years ago, Windows Update was probably the bane of everyone’s existence. People had to worry about Windows restarting in the middle of a presentation or at the time one would least expect it. With the original version of 10 though, it arguably took a turn for the worse. Now that Windows was a service model, updates would be delivered forcefully. It was hard for home users to opt out of certain updates, including ones that could break your hardware if not compatible.

Eventually, Microsoft added some features to ease the pain of such updates. Active Hours were added in a new feature update, which allowed one to set some time for which Windows would not reboot for updates. This was helpful for things like meetings, presentations, etc. You could also pause updates, like if you found out that Microsoft released a premature build, or the build is known to be faulty with software/hardware.

Updates became faster as well. Initially, updates often took hours to install and take effect. It’s still funny for me to think about how fast build updates are now compared to the times of long past.

This next one is a huge boon for all power users. When Microsoft releases a major feature update, you don’t have to install them immediately. It doesn’t enforce the update upon you (unless your current Windows 10 version is “end-of-life”).

**Your Phone app integration**

Yeah, yeah, we all know about the sad phone operating system named Windows Phone. You might think that Microsoft still stinks when it comes to the prospects of mobile. Think again, though. In the iOS App Store, Microsoft reigns top when it comes to the top free apps and paid apps (Mixer and Minecraft are both #1 in each category, respectively).

Sorry, I deflected from the current issue there, though. Long story short, Microsoft now plays nicely with your phone. With the Your Phone app, you can now sync and integrate your Android phone with your Windows computer. Think of it as a rival to the Apple ecosystem integration. If you’ve got a Samsung or a OnePlus device, you can sync and receive your text messages on your computer in real time, and even respond to them on your computer. You could also copy photos from your phone (from the recent 25).

There are even wacky features like getting Android notifications on your Windows computer or even mirroring your phone screen on your computer (can iOS even do that?).

Before you answer, I know that the Apple ecosystem still continues to be more seamless and efficient than any of the competition. However, give the Your Phone app and Android a try. It’s really maturing.

**WSL and Windows Terminal: A Huge Boon for Developers!**

I’ve touched on this topic several times (see my earlier blog posts regarding the Terminal and WSL). A change in behavior from Microsoft’s snarky past about Linux, the feature has been a huge asset for developers. With WSL, one can now emulate a Linux/Unix terminal environment natively in Windows. That’s right. The Linux commands now play nicely with the NTFS filesystem, so you don’t have to go with a more extreme solution such as Cygwin or Microsoft’s now-discontinued Windows Services for UNIX. Many have turned to Macs thanks to its better UNIX support, but that should change in the future.

Couple that with the new Windows Terminal. This highly-customizable terminal is way more user-friendly than the Command Prompt, with configurable tabs, profiles, and text behaviors. With these two solutions, development on Windows should take a turn for the better.

However, even though I’m a fan of Windows and Windows 10, there’s a lot of ways it can be improved. Let’s take a look below.

# Windows 10/Microsoft issues

**Design Inconsistencies**

This big issue has been prevalent even since the launch date, and while it has gotten better over time, the design issues have still been quite noticeable. The new dark mode in Windows 10 switches most of the UI and apps to dark mode, however, legacy elements such as the Control Panel and printer advanced settings do not change.

Microsoft has traced some of the issues due to backwards compatibility with MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows applications, but it shouldn’t be hard for them to change classic dialogs or legacy elements like the ones mentioned above. Hopefully, they keep this issue high on their priority list.

IMAGE: The inconsistent window styles should really give this away. Windows was set to dark mode, yet Control Panel is still in light mode.

**Registry**

Ah, this one. This has been a problem with every Windows version since 3.1 or 95. The Windows Registry is a database that maintains centralized settings for each app, game, or the OS itself. 

Oftentimes, you can tweak some registry settings to speed up your computer or modify Windows’s behavior. In some cases, however, you may have seen warnings that a careless alteration to the Registry could cause Windows to fail to boot. That’s quite an issue. With backwards compatibility and the amount of settings given by each app, the Registry becomes even more bloated as every new version of Windows comes out. 

The fact that Windows could even crash due to a single modification in the Registry shows that the Registry could be a single point of failure, and it’s the reason why Microsoft has it hidden from beginners or novices.

It’s something that Microsoft can’t really fix though, because of backwards compatibility with older Windows versions or apps, so I guess we can give them a pass.

**Microsoft’s forced behavior (upgrades and even now)**

When Microsoft launched Windows 10 in 2015, they put out a free upgrade offer for Windows 7/8.1 users to upgrade to 10, valid for only a year. While it’s nice to not shell out your wallet for a new Windows product key/license, it arguably took a turn for the worse after people learned that Microsoft forced upgrades on some machines. This took up valuable disk space and, if the system wasn’t compatible with some machines, could crash the system and render it unbootable.

In addition, Microsoft had forced it in another way, in that the “I refuse button” was disabled and the user had no choice but to upgrade.

Even as a Microsoft fan, I understand the difficulties that many have had with Windows 10, and that Microsoft’s behavior during these times was highly inappropriate, giving the user virtually little control over their system. They’ve acknowledged their behavior on this issue, and apologized, eventually giving the user the opportunity to deny the upgrade as time went on and the upgrade offer was close to expiry.

There were a bunch of other anticompetitive behaviors by Microsoft in Windows 10, such as ads for OneDrive in File Explorer, the lock screen, and “Switching-to-Edge” dialogs when the user proceeded to open Chrome or Firefox. LIKE CHILL, BRO! Good news is that most of them have also phased out over time.

# Conclusion

Whew, I’m done for now. There’s a lot to like about Windows, four years into Windows 10’s lifespan. It’s more user-friendly for developers, gamers, businesses, and casual users. While some may not appreciate some of the changes (UWP Settings, Cortana, etc.), as was the case with Windows 8, it’s nevertheless felt quite modern compared to OS’s like XP and Windows 7, especially with all the productivity and connectivity enhancements.

There are still some issues that need to be ironed out, however, most of them can’t thanks to Microsoft’s renewed commitment to MS-DOS and Windows 9x (95, 98, Me) backwards compatibility.

With that, read the following below, and see you on here soon.
