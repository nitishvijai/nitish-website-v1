# Introduction and History

Whenever someone asks you about desktop and laptop computer operating systems, you might say you’ve heard of either Apple macOS or Microsoft Windows, the two market leaders in the playing field of computer software (with the latter even greater than the former). However, you might not know of a third competitor: Linux.

So, what exactly is Linux? Well, Linux is an operating system that serves as one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software.

The first Linux kernel was launched in 1991 by a computer science pioneer known as Linus Torvalds, although it mainly took off in the mid-1990s, while Microsoft was being scrutinized for their anticompetitive behavior and vendor lock-in practices throughout the 80s and 90s in the US v. Microsoft antitrust trials. A video from around the release of Windows 98 shows the amount of protests and Linux campaigns on a day that was popularly known as [Windows Refund Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1j9j-Ywjmbk).

Linux is similar to both macOS and Windows in the sense that it’s a family of operating systems (Linux itself is just a kernel; more on that below) that you can install on your computer. However, these operating systems share many fundamental differences.

# Differences between macOS and Windows vs. Linux

macOS and Windows are proprietary software. That is, software that’s copyrighted and limited against modification and distribution by the vendor (in this case, Apple and Microsoft). On the other hand, Linux is open source software. This means that the source code for the Linux kernel is free to view and modify for anyone.

macOS and Windows licenses usually cost money, thanks to their status as proprietary software. However, Linux is free! If you’re the type of person who likes to tinker with software and modify it, you’re all good to go.

Collectively, Linux comprises of many different flavors, or distros. This variety means there’s different ways to experience Linux on your computer! These distros run on the Linux kernel. For a common example, we’ll talk about Android. Android OS runs on the Linux kernel, opening the end-user up to a greater field of customization – this is why Google licenses Android to different manufacturers (OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, etc.), who add their own twists and turns to the operating system. Like these manufacturers, the popular distribution developers of distros like Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch Linux often add their own twists and turns to the Linux kernel. As a Linux user, you’ve got the ability to swap user-interface and core components, allowing you to truly make your system your own.

Even though you will usually almost always see a MacBook or another Windows computer at a coffee shop or in the workplace, Linux is more common than you might think it is. In fact, it’s everywhere – even in the places you don’t realize! It runs from your phones, your smart appliances, a multitude of Internet and desktop servers, and the most innovative supercomputers out there. Your favorite sites (Google and Twitter) use Linux servers just so that you can use their services reliably and securely. There are no limits to the vast power and autonomy that Linux provides.

Side note: I was flying on a plane, watching a movie in the night time. However, there was a software crash, causing all the entertainment systems to shut down and reboot. When the system rebooted, the familiar Linux penguin (Tux) and a terminal interface appeared on the screen. I was in middle school at the time, so the terminal really confused the heck out of me. However, the appearance of Linux on an entertainment system high in the sky really shows that there’s no limits to the wackiest places you can find a Linux OS on.

# Problems with Linux

However, there are downsides to Linux as well on the consumer-level – like there are on Windows and macOS. While Windows is inhibited thanks to backwards compatibility and the aging constraints of MS-DOS and macOS is restrictive thanks to its walled garden and price (especially on Apple hardware), Linux can have its own share of problems.

There are quite a few distros out there that have a simple user experience and are easy to set up and use, but some of them tend to require quite a bit of technical knowledge (mostly when working on the command line). If you are new to computing, stay away from Linux. 

Side note: I’ve been a Windows guy all my life and I've had to use Linux for my recent internship. I have had little to no experience with Linux before. This internship really changed that though; the vast amount of troubleshooting I’ve had to do with getting files to work in Linux embedded devices have really taught me a lot about Bash, Unix commands, and the Linux terminal, as well as the filesystem and directories. Definitely not an easy task unless you’re up for the challenge.

Secondly, macOS and Windows have a greater market share, so there’s a higher chance that the app you’re looking for will be on one of those two operating systems. Linux may not have the number of programs and games that you might want (on the flipside, you will have open source applications to download on Linux). Want to use Microsoft Office or Final Cut Pro X? Do you use Xbox Cross-Play or play the latest PC games like *Forza* or *Halo*? If so, you’re better off sticking with macOS or Windows (gamers especially).

Finally, this is a big one out there. Relatively few vendors sell their machines with Linux (although this is slowly changing, with Dell’s laptops offering you a choice for years now and Lenovo releasing a new line of ThinkPads that solely run Linux), so there’s a higher chance that you’re going to have to configure Linux yourself and manually hunt down digitally-signed drivers that will allow Linux to run optimally on your hardware. 

Personally, I first learned of Linux in elementary school while I was at a TechFest event at Sinclair Community College, where a group of Ubuntu enthusiasts at a booth gave away free CDs to install and test Linux. At the time, I hated it because it felt super slow and clunky to me. However, now that I work with it every day at my internship, Ubuntu Linux has improved a lot and it’s now an enjoyable experience.

# Conclusion - is Linux right for you?

Here are some questions for you to consider before making the switch:

Are you new to computers or afraid of advanced troubleshooting? If that’s the case, don’t even touch Linux. You’re better off with Windows or macOS.

Are you the kind of person who likes to tinker with open-source software and do it all yourself (drivers especially)? If so, Linux is for you.

Do you mind the lack of reputed software (Microsoft Office, Photoshop) in favor of third-party replacements (LibreOffice, GIMP)? If so, you won’t miss much with a switch to Linux. Gamers especially: STICK. TO. WINDOWS.

If you’re not interested in shelling out money to buy a Mac computer, you can easily build your own computer with the same specs for less money. Doing this will give you greater options than a Mac: you can either put Windows or a sweet Linux distro on it. Do mind, however, that a new Windows license will cost approx. $100 whereas you could just burn a Linux distro ISO image to a CD-ROM or USB flash drive for free.

Eventually, I’m sure that you’ll come to love whatever works for you. I truly appreciate Linux and have fun using it from time to time, but I’ve got my own reasons for why I will remain on Windows for the foreseeable future.

1.	I’ve had my current Microsoft account since the sixth grade, so I’ve been on the Microsoft ecosystem for a long time (Windows, Office, Outlook, Surface, Bing, Xbox, OneDrive, etc.). When you’re in an ecosystem, your products/devices really work in sync (Apple adopts a similar strategy with their devices: it’s how they keep their users from switching to other platforms).

2.	I’m a proud owner of a Surface Pro 4 (soon upgrading to a Surface Book 2). To date, I think that Windows 10 is the best touch-oriented operating system (better than macOS or Linux). When the same company makes the hardware and software, it’s bound to work as a dynamic duo (similar to macOS on MacBooks).

3.	I’m a developer, so I like to use Visual Studio. I enjoy using the Linux Bash terminal as well though so I enabled it on Windows via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (blog post on this coming next week).

If you’re not a fan of Windows, I do recommend Linux, and I recommend that you try it out on a secondary machine (trust me, you’ll be REALLY disappointed if you install it on your main computer and you find that it doesn’t suit your needs). You could also dual boot it and install it alongside Windows or Mac on your computer (although this will take more time and effort).

If you’re ready to try out Linux, I suggest you start out by downloading Ubuntu here: https://ubuntu.com/ (click on Download at the top). I hope you find out what works for you.

In addition, myself and Stack Overflow are always here to help with your concerns. Catch you later!

P.S. if you do plan to use the Terminal, do become familiar with the SUDO command. With it, YOU essentially gain root permissions, making YOU the superuser… MUA-HA-HA-HA! I wanted to make another joke about SUDO here but I decided I would be going too far had I posted it. Oh well.
