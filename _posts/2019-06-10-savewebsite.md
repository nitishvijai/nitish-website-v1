Hey everyone! If you'd like to save this website and blog to your computer or smartphone, there are easy ways to do that for all your devices! These instructions are for Microsoft Edge and Chrome on Windows 8/8.1/10, Safari on iOS and macOS, and Chrome on Android. Whatever device you've got, it's not too hard to bookmark or save the website to your home screen / Start menu / bookmarks bar.

Find the instructions for your device below:

TIP: Duplicate this tab and perform these instructions on the other tab, so that way you won't lose these to follow.

<b>Windows 10 only - Legacy Microsoft Edge browser</b>:
1. I assume you're already on this website. Go to the homepage using the top navigation links.

2. Click on the ... icon at the end of the toolbar.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Edge2.png" />
3. Hover over More tools, and in the resulting menu, click on Pin this page to Start.

4. Now, you've got a slick Live Tile with a 3D design crafted by yours truly :).

<b>Windows 8/8.1/10 - Microsoft Edge Insider Dev Channel / Google Chrome browser</b>:
No screenshots on this one. Directions and layout are virtually similar to legacy Edge browser.
1. I assume you're already on this website. Go to the homepage using the top navigation links.
2. Click on the ... icon at the end of the toolbar.
3. Hover over More tools, and in the resulting menu, click on Pin to Desktop.
4. You'll only be getting a desktop shortcut. If you want a Live Tile, right click on the shortcut and select Pin to Start. It's sadly not as cool but I sure hope Google is reading this.

<b>iOS/iPadOS - Apple Safari browser</b>:
Unfortunately, I do not own an iPhone (Android rules! That's for another day though), so I cannot include screenshots. Follow the directions as best as you can.
1. I assume you're already on this website. Go to the homepage using the top navigation links.
2. Tap the Share button on the menu bar (it looks like a box with an upright arrow).
3. Tap on Add to Home Screen.
4. Give your new icon a funky-sounding name, then click Add.
5. New "app" looks beautiful, right?

<b>macOS - Apple Safari browser</b>:
1. I assume you're already on this website. Go to the homepage using the top navigation links.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Safari1.png" />
2. Open the Window menu on the menu bar.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Safari2.png" />
3. Select Pin Tab. If not, you can always add the site to your bookmarks bar.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Safari3.png" />
4. Another cool thing is that if you're on a 2016 MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar or later, the icon will appear on the Touch Bar. Pretty nifty huh?

<b>Android - Google Chrome browser</b>:
1. Open the Chrome app and go to the homepage.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Android2.png" />
2. Tap on the "three dot" button at the top right.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Android3.png" />
3. Tap on Add to Home screen in the resulting menu.
<img src="../../../assets/img/Android4.png" />
4. Give your icon another funky-sounding name (one that you could preferably easily remember).
<img src="../../../assets/img/Android5.png" />
5. Tap Add, then return to your home screen.

6. Oops, it looks like mine was a bit too long. What's sweet is that when you open a shortcut via Chrome for Android, it opens up like its own app, hiding the main toolbar (might be the same on iOS but I'm not sure).

I think that's all for now, folks. I'm looking into a desktop notification / commenting system for this blog to put these icons to better use, so I'll report on that once I can find some way to implement those systems.

Hope these instructions help,
Nitish V.
