Apologies for the quite lengthy post, but I wanted to make this post as more developers leave Windows these days for the more-UNIX-friendly macOS and Linux operating systems. The new Terminal seems very captivating as well, so I wanted to talk about my experience using it and commend the great engineers at Microsoft who work to improve our digital lives every day.

NOTE: Everything in this blog article is my personal opinion. I’m trying my best to not be biased (being a Windows fan, of course) or unreliable here. In addition, this is my first review, and I’m no MKBHD or Dave Lee, so I’m still getting into it.

# Introduction

For a long time, Microsoft Windows has shipped with what we know as the infamous Command Prompt. It has had the ability to run MS-DOS commands for the past 34 years, starting with Windows 1.0. With the release of the new rock-solid Windows NT kernel in 1993, it’s become a general command line for developers and non-developers alike. However, the Command Prompt (until Windows 10), has basically been the same since the release of Windows 2000. As the Linux and macOS terminals advanced with Bash and the Unix filesystem in the 2000s, the Windows Command Prompt was often the butt of jokes, allowing for little customization that paled in comparison to the Bash command line.

# Problems with Command Prompt

For years, users have been demanding that the Command Prompt is antiquated, considering that it doesn’t have the little features that people would grow to appreciate, such as tabs, full-screen maximize, proper font rendering, or better customization. However, since Windows is easily one of the most modern backwards-compatible systems in the market today, it’s not easy for Microsoft to implement these changes. By adding new features to such a widely-used feature (and one so archaic), it can break compatibility with certain scripts and programs designed for earlier versions of Windows (Windows 95, Windows 98, etc.). As an example, businesses still use MS-DOS and old MS-DOS scripts that rely on Command Prompt. A fundamental change to the Command Prompt could change the behavior of the scripts as we know it, and it’s quite risky to apply this change, especially on the macro scale where one tiny change could rapidly produce unexpected and unwanted behavior for everyone involved. It’s for this reason that MS-DOS file conventions and limitations are still used in certain areas of Windows. 

Underutilized operating systems like macOS do not have this issue (think about it. Apple has changed the CPU architecture four times – from the Motorola 68k to IBM PowerPC in 1994 to Intel x86 in 2006 and now to ARM in 2020. Can someone come up with a guess on how many legacy applications Apple broke in the process?).

Side note: for those who don’t know, MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) used to be like a car engine. Entering a command to launch the graphical shell in MS-DOS (C:\> WIN) would ignite the engine, starting the car (Windows). The tedious routine of entering the command was gone with the release of Windows 95, where MS-DOS generally booted Windows automatically. In the end, these MS-DOS underpinnings were removed upon converging both the Windows 9x (95, 98, 98 SE, & ME) and Windows NT (3.1, 3.51, 4.0, 2000, XP, and all modern versions of Windows today) OS families for the release of Windows XP in 2001 (besides MS-DOS emulation for backwards compatibility purposes).

Back in the days where Microsoft was determined to exterminate open source software (e.g. Linux), it became harder to do development on Windows (except if you were running a .NET stack in Visual Studio). For even the simplest Linux Bash commands, people had to resort to third-party tools such as Cygwin or shell out their money to purchase Microsoft’s then-software Windows Services for UNIX. Even then, it didn’t maintain full parity with the vast majority of Linux distros. On the other hand of the computing spectrum, Mac and Linux users were good to go. All the necessary development tools would most likely have been ready to install in the command line already, so no time had to be wasted further configuring them.

# Solution

Even though it may have not seemed like it, Microsoft was listening. After all, the folks up north at Redmond had a fantastic new idea: the Windows Terminal! The Windows Terminal is a new terminal emulator, supporting command lines for Command Prompt, PowerShell, WSL distros, and SSH.

Around the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft loosened their position on open source software (former CEO Steve Ballmer called it “a cancer” in 2001), and in an official conference in 2016, embraced the open source Linux kernel. Microsoft is now one of the largest open source software contributors on GitHub. To help Mac and Linux developers swiftly move to Windows, Microsoft released the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) that same year. WSL provides a Linux compatibility layer on Windows, allowing users to run Linux commands and binary executables natively. This was a great solution, however, I/O performance suffered because Windows translates Linux programs and commands to run on the Windows NT kernel, often taking a long time (this was later addressed in WSL 2, when Microsoft included a full-blown Linux kernel inside Windows for greater compatibility and faster native I/O speeds). 

Along with WSL 2, the Windows Terminal was announced last month at Microsoft’s official BUILD 2019 keynote. The concept video on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gw0rXPMMPE&app=desktop) looks very promising, with Microsoft’s new design vision, Fluent Design, present in all facets of the new Terminal (the music really triggers me though). In the video, tabs were present, with a button allowing you to add a new tab for CMD, PowerShell, or a terminal for any Linux distros you installed. Clicking links in the new terminal would open a container window to launch websites, which to me, really sounds like a killer productivity feature. Microsoft also added emoji support and greater color personalization options to the console as well. 

That’s not too crazy though. What’s REALLY crazy is the fact that the video got 1.5 million views, with 49K likes and 1.3K dislikes. I’ve never seen this much excitement for a command line terminal before (and it really shows that Microsoft is doing something right here).

The Windows Terminal is not designed to fully replace the legacy-based consoles (Command Prompt and PowerShell), but it’s a tool that developers and casual users can now use to manage your system, commit to Git repositories, install other development tools easily, and run PowerShell, CMD scripts, and Linux commands on.

# My Experience

After watching Microsoft’s concept video for the new Terminal, I was quite excited. The console experience on Windows really needed something new, and the new Terminal really exceeded my expectations. However, it wasn’t available just yet. The final version of the Terminal comes out later this year. However, as a member of the Windows Insider Program (a program for beta testers), I was able to try out a beta version of the Terminal on the latest Windows 10 build. 

However, I didn’t want to do the tedious task of downloading the preview of the Terminal from GitHub and building it. Luckily, I was scrolling through my Twitter feed (if you haven’t already, follow me here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedjvj). You won’t regret it!) two days ago, and I saw a Tweet from Microsoft’s Community Manager Jen Gentleman (follow her at [@jenmsft](https://twitter.com/JenMsft)), who stated that the Windows Terminal was all good to go after launching it from the Microsoft Store.

Another side note: look at all her Windows Terminal tweets. Quite wacky, if you ask me.

After seeing her Tweet, I got down to business. I installed the free Windows Terminal beta preview from the Microsoft Store, and within seconds, it worked without a hitch.

On first glance, I was quite impressed. Admittedly, it doesn’t look much like the Terminal from the concept video, but we’re getting there. I’m using Windows 10 in dark mode with a purple accent color, so that explains the weird shift in the title bar.

I found that switching to light mode does not change the title bar tab color until you restart the Terminal. Hopefully, Microsoft will come out with a way to change this automatically. Upon starting the new Windows Terminal, a PowerShell tab starts up by default, with a tab name set to the file path of the PowerShell console. The link does not highlight with an underline or start a web browser instance just yet.

Clicking on the “+” icon will start a new PowerShell tab by default (I believe you can change this in the settings). However, clicking on the Down menu button next to it will give you a list of options for what console tab you want to open.

Here's an instance of CMD running in the Terminal (gotta love that Fluent Design transparency in the background):

An instance of DLL hell (according to Apple's Bertrand Serlet) highlighted by WSL Ubuntu in the Terminal:

At the moment, clicking on the Settings menu item launches a new instance of Visual Studio 2019. It opens the profiles.json file (basically similar to Visual Studio Code settings), where I can remap keyboard shortcuts, change column and row settings, modify the acrylic color settings for the Terminal, or even change Terminal behavior (title bar, etc.). For the common user, however, it would be WAYYY easier had there been a GUI (graphical user interface) for changing these settings, instead of having the user performing trial-and-error on which setting did what. Having to change these settings through a text file would result in lost productivity, and it’s really not a robust method for modifying the interface.

Emoji support is also lacking on the new Terminal, resulting in question marks in place of the emojis on PowerShell and CMD (it works decently on WSL Ubuntu).

Image: Emoji support on Windows Terminal is quite poor at the moment - only works on WSL distros.

However, it’s important to note that this Terminal is still in the beta stage, giving Microsoft ample time to fix any bugfixes, add more settings, and improve the experience for everyone. In spite of the flaws it has, I think it’s time to celebrate on what exists in the Terminal.

# Is the Windows Terminal ready for mainstream use?

Short answer: No.

Fuzzy answer: It’s getting there.

Long answer: 
After my first experience with the Terminal, I noticed that it truly got a lot of things right where the original CMD and PowerShell consoles got wrong. Developer experience is now a breeze thanks to new features such as tabs, emojis, and fast console switching. Fonts really look nicer in this new terminal thanks to the inclusion of GPU-accelerated text rendering. The new acrylic Fluent Design view is an appreciative added touch that in my opinion, makes working with the command line much more fun. Speedy startup times and swift console execution truly make the experience more productive and efficient.

However, there are improvements to be made in order for this to be the ultimate command line terminal. At the time of this writing, pasting via CTRL+V only works in PowerShell (in CMD and WSL, CTRL+V shows up as “^V” in the terminal). For the non-techies, allowing the user to change settings via a window (not editing a JSON text file) would enhance productivity and user experience even further. The terminal would be better off with more keyboard shortcuts, such as CTRL+N to open a new window. Faster transitions for dark/light mode would be highly appreciated as well. Saving prior screen position should be added.

The macOS terminal isn’t inhibited by the various compromises of legacy MS-DOS (remember, MS-DOS dates back to the 1980s) on CMD and the other consoles of the Windows terminal. However, Microsoft has more time to work on these issues to truly transform this console into one of the most premium tools for development.

# Conclusion (in a nutshell):

The Windows Terminal, in its current stage, has great potential and is an excellent start to a smoother command line experience on Windows 10. It works smarter than Command Prompt or PowerShell windows. However, the Mac and Linux Bash terminals and other third-party terminals such as CMDer and Hyper have more features at the moment. On the official Microsoft Store app page, Microsoft themselves stated that “this very early preview release includes many usability issues, most notably the lack of support for assistive technology. Much of the internal work to support this is complete and it’s our top priority to support assistive technology very soon.” It’s ideas like these that make the new Windows Terminal seem more promising with every release.

It satisfies my needs, but I’m not sure about you, the reader. That’s why I highly recommend you to give it a chance: only through experimentation do we know more about the tool or task at hand. Despite any missing features it has, the new Terminal goes a long way in improving the lives and productivity of Windows developers, and hats off to the Windows engineers who helped it get this far.

If you’re interested in the Windows Terminal and want to follow its development, I recommend that you follow Microsoft’s Rich Turner’s Twitter account at [@richturn_ms](https://twitter.com/richturn_ms). He’s a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft who helped bring Linux and WSL to Windows and deliver the Windows Terminal. There’s a lot of success stories he retweeted on his account that may help you sway your decision.
