For years, Macs have been the default weapon of choice, but with Microsoft’s renewed commitment to Linux on Windows 10, it really looks like the tables are turning (albeit slowly). Read the article to find out more!

Also, I was out at orientation last weekend, so I did kind of forget to post this last week, but oh well.

# Intro - short rehash of Windows Terminal excerpt

I’ve been taking a great interest into the Linux operating system over the past couple of years, and my willingness to learn the multitude of commands on the Bash shell only spiked when I installed Ubuntu on my Windows 10 desktop (no virtual machine; full terminal!). Three weeks ago, I wrote about the new Windows Terminal and its great advancements to the console on Windows. A week later, I wrote about what Linux is. Now that you know what Linux is, there’s a vast array of options to emulate the Linux development experience on Windows. You may have heard of Cygwin and Windows Services for UNIX (now discontinued), but have you heard about the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Microsoft’s new official method for running Linux programs and terminal commands on Windows?

WSL came at a time when Macs and macOS had become every developer’s companion thanks to its status as a POSIX-certified operating system. POSIX-certified ensures that there’s software compatibility between Unix variants and other operating systems. The Unix shell was also more powerful than Windows’s DOS Command Prompt, which was only getting more archaic as time passed on.

# What is the Windows Subsystem for Linux?

In 2016, Microsoft released the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL provides a Linux compatibility layer on Windows, allowing users and developers to execute Linux commands and executables natively on a Windows computer.

The project came about just as Microsoft cancelled Project Astoria, a bridge which allowed Android developers to port Android apps to run on Microsoft’s Windows Phone (rest in peace). Astoria faced multiple delays during development and was shelved in favor of Xamarin, another solution for cross-platform app development using the C# language. The technologies behind Project Astoria were reused to develop WSL as we know it today. 

WSL 1.0 was released in August 2016 with support for only one distro, Ubuntu on 64-bit Windows 10. Eventually, more distros became available, such as SUSE, Debian, and others. While faster than previous attempts at Linux emulation on Windows, native I/O speeds were often slow thanks to the translation layer present in translating Linux commands to system calls on the Windows NT kernel.

Recently however, Microsoft released WSL 2.0 in a relatively new Windows 10 Insider build. This is a significant step as Microsoft removed the translation layer, instead opting to go with a full-blown Linux kernel inside Windows. Such a move would enhance compatibility with greater Linux calls and improve native I/O operation speeds, resulting in a productivity boon for casual Linux users and developers alike. 

Now that you know the gist of WSL, here's how to run Linux programs on your Windows computer!

# Installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux

First and foremost, if you haven’t updated your computer, do it now. In order to use WSL 1.0, you will need Windows 10 build 16215 or later (Fall Creators Update).

If you want to use WSL 2.0 (the one with faster I/O speeds), you will need to have Windows 10 build 18917 or later (20H1). At the moment, the build can only be downloaded if you are on the Windows Insider Program. Thus, if you want to download WSL 2.0, enroll in the Windows Insider Program. It’s fast, free, and an easy way to download beta Windows 10 builds and try out new features before the general population receives them.

To enroll in the Windows Insider Program, click on Start (Windows logo) and type “Settings” to open Settings.

Next, click on “Update & Security” and on the sidebar that pops up, click on “Windows Insider Program.” Follow the instructions to join. I personally joined the Fast ring because I enjoy being a guinea pig to see the latest and greatest in Windows first over everyone else.

You’ll most likely be asked to restart your PC before you can download and install beta builds via Windows Update.

Once you’ve got that business taken care of, click on the Windows Update button and install the latest updates.

Now that your computer is all up-to-date, it’s time to get virtual Linux (except not really) running and ready to use on your PC.

NOTE: All steps below are for Windows 10 only. Windows Server 2016 and 2019 require additional configuration steps in order to use WSL on those platforms. Microsoft has official documentation available on their site.

Click on Start  and type in “Control Panel.” The configuration wizard for adding WSL as an optional feature is only available through the classic Control Panel, not on the UWP Settings app. Next, click on “Programs and Features” (if you’re in Category mode, click on “Programs” instead). Then, on the left-hand pane, click on “Turn Windows features on or off.” In the box that appears, scroll down and make sure that “Windows Subsystem for Linux” is checked.

Once you've done that and the addition is successful, restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

# Picking your distro of choice

You’ve installed Windows Subsystem for Linux, but you can’t use it yet. There’s no distro to emulate the Linux terminal! To fix that, open up the Microsoft Store at the bottom. Next, type “Linux” in the Search box, then click on the link that says “Run Linux on Windows.”

<img src="../../../assets/img/WSL5.jpg" />
IMAGE: Microsoft Store is open. Type "Linux" and click on "Run Linux on Windows."

Next, you’ll be presented with a page of choices. If you’re a beginner to Linux, I would personally install Ubuntu.

Click on your distro, then hit the Install/Get button on the page. Once it’s done installing, hit “Launch.”

At the moment, hitting the button will open a new Command Prompt window. You’ll have to wait out a few minutes for the distro to configure itself. Once that’s done, you’ll be prompted to enter a UNIX account username and password. They do not have to be the same as your Windows credentials.

NOTE: If you choose to elevate a command with admin (SUDO) permissions, you'll need to enter your password, so make sure you can remember it!

Once you’ve set up your distro, make sure to update your Linux packages with the commands `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`.

Now, you’ve got the full power of Linux in your hands. If you want to make it even better, follow the steps below to install WSL 2.0…

# Optional: Installing WSL 2.0

Before continuing, ensure that your machine is up to date (Build 18917 with the Insider Program) and that you have WSL 1.0 installed first.

Go back to the Programs and Features page in Control Panel, then click on “Turn Windows features on or off” in the left-hand side. Now, ensure that the feature "Virtual Machine Platform is checked". Windows will install the feature, and then, you’ll have to restart your PC to save the changes.

Once you restart your PC, open up a new Terminal or PowerShell window, and type in `wsl –set-version #distro# 2`, where distro is the Linux distro you’ve installed. To see what distros you’ve installed, type in `wsl -l`.

It will take a few minutes to install WSL 2.0, then you'll be good!

NOTE: WSL 2.0 can run alongside WSL 1.0 for compatibility purposes. This means that WSL 1.0 will not be uninstalled.

# Conclusion

After following this tutorial, you should have a fast and simple way to access a Linux terminal on your Windows PC. In addition, this should hopefully ease some tensions about developers on Mac or Linux on potentially switching to Windows, the platform that many have avoided over the past five years. *

Install a Linux program on WSL for Windows and be amazed!

Peace out,

P.S.: I actually mean it when I say that Windows is getting better at platform development. I don’t want to rant on here, so I’ll save it for later.
