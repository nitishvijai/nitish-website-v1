# Projects

### Cmail (C#/CMD/Console-Based Gmail Client)
<i>April 2020 - Present</i>
<br/>Cmail is a console-based Gmail client app written in C#. This app makes use of the Gmail RESTful API to send and view messages, threads, account details, etc. This app is mainly a learning project for me, where I've learned the ins and outs of using the Gmail API in C# .NET, console-based C#, etc.

### Eventempo
<i>December 2019 - April 2020</i>
<br/>Eventempo is an UWP countdown timer app for Windows 10 devices. Some features include support for multiple event countdown timers, easy add/edit event page, automatic saving of events in between sessions, year/month/day/hour/minute/second countdown, colorful event customization, and notification alerts at 5 minutes remaining and at time. I worked on this app during winter break of my freshman year in college, and I've learned a lot of C#, XAML, and UWP app concepts, such as asynchronous programming, responsive app layouts, file I/O, etc. This is my first app, and I mainly created it to learn more about mobile/desktop app design.

# Internships

### Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
<b>Dayton, Ohio</b> | <i>June 2019 - August 2019</i>
<br/>This summer, I had an engineering internship at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, working under the mentorship of Lt. Col. Mark DeYoung. My main goal was to automate benchmark analysis on remote devices via Python and gather power and performance measurements via the ActiveDSO Win32 control for establishing an SSH connection to an oscilloscope. Throughout this internship, I gained many technical skills such as Python scripting and SSH/remote networking as well as career skills, such as debugging and testing. An outbriefing will be posted on here shortly.

### MSC Technology
<b>Chennai, India</b> | <i>June 2018 - August 2018</i>
<br/>I taught myself JavaScript, jQuery, and SQL on the job. In addition, I was tasked with improving the company's human resource management system (HRMS) webpages using ASP .NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In the end, my improvements were published onto the live development stream. Throughout this internship, I learned about web development, the software development life cycle (SDLC), and the Agile method utilized.
