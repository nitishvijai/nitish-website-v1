# nitishvijai.github.io (Old Personal Website v1.0)

## Version 2.0 [link](https://github.com/nitishvijai/nitish-website-v2/)

### UPDATE 6/11/2020

This repository was created almost a year ago, after I graduated from high school. I used a GitHub Pages template to create my site, so I ended up not learning much. Please check out v2.0 above!

Thanks to GitHub's rules regarding GitHub Pages, I've had to delete the original site's repository! Luckily, I've taken a backup of all the original files and I've readded them to this repo.

### This repo is an archive of my first GitHub Pages site as it existed before I published the new version (2.0) of the site on June 11th, 2020.
